#Company Stocks TimeSeries and Forecast with Plots

This program takes the data from a company's **.csv** file (locally stored) and uses timeseries fucntion and forecast function with [Holt-Winters](https://forecasters.org/pdfs/foresight/free/Issue19_goodwin.pdf) flitering to help plot and visualize the company's stock performance which can be used for further analysis accordingly.<br>
To be able to use this program, one has to download a comapny's stock .csv file (can download multiple year .csv's, like I did for the program which has files from year 1985, 1995, 2000 and 2010), which can easily be downloaded from [**Yahoo Finance**](http://finance.yahoo.com/).<br>
Also, one has to have the libraries used in the program.<br>
To install them use the command **require**, for eg: **require(tseries)**
